Now a day’s fire defending system in our country is becoming poor and poor. To overcome from this situation, we need to do something more
special that’s why we proposed a hardware-based solution. It will work as fire fighter but using the technology of IOT. Early detection of
the fire which produces a rapid action is essential in any firefighting system. A suggested smart system based on Internet of things is 
presented. Arduino Mega 2560 with the flame sensors is the core of the proposed system to detect the fire. The entire city is monitored 
remotely via the Internet by the smart center of firefighting, which is distributed in various locations. Device Bit and Blank platforms 
have been used for monitoring and sending notification immediately with the fire location to the smart center of firefighting. The 
proposed system is designed and implemented to be flexible, efficient with low cost to be practical and applicable
