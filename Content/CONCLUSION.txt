The proposed IOT based fire fighter in this paper is flexible, efficient, and low cost and can be applied to cities using simple tools. This system allows the possibility of monitoring the whole city through the Network and has the ability to detect the fire places in the city in real time. Immediate response to the event can be provided to take series primary procedures at the scene of the fire. This system provides the information to the firemen to respond quickly and controlling the fire which prevent it from spreading. This will prevent the significant losses of life and property; reduces air pollution from the smoke that resulting from the fire and eventually keep the environment clean. The proposed system will overcome the problems of the traditional firefighting system including the late response. Future work may include adding more to the system such as monitoring the traffic to give directions to the firefighting to reach the fire place quicker. The other platform used is Device Bit; it is used for monitoring through the web page that can be displayed on computer screen or smart phone screen. The detection of the fire location could be through the web page, if a fire occurs in the place, the value appears beside the name of the exact place that the fire happened, otherwise the value will be appeared, figures show the results obtained.
