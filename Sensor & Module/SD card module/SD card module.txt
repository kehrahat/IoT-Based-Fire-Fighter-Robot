The micro- SD Card Module is a simple solution for transferring data to and from a standard SD card. The pin out is directly compatible with Arduino, but can also be used with other microcontrollers. It allows you to add mass storage and data logging to your project. This module has SPI interface which is compatible with any SD card and it use 5V or 3.3V power supply which is compatible with Arduino UNO/Mega. SD module has various applications such as data logger, audio, video, graphics. This module will greatly expand the capability an Arduino can do with their poor limited memory.
