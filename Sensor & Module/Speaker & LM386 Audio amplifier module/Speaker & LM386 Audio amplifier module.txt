The LM386 Audio Amplifier Module is a mono audio amplifier based on the LM386 chip. It goes by various names and descriptions such as "LM386 Audio Amplifier Module 200 Times 5V-12V Input 10K Adjustable Resistance. LM386M chip is available in a SO package (M) manufactured by Texas Instruments, and operates on a voltage range between 4 V and 12 V. It has an absolute maximum rating of 15 V. Package (M) has a dissipation rating of 0.73 W. The LM386M version of the chip will provide a typical output of 325 mW, when the supply voltage is 6 V and the speaker load 8 Ω. A 9 V battery power supply will provide an output of around 500 mW. The size of the PCB is 41 mm × 13 mm, manufactured using SMD components, and arrives ready assembled. This will save the user much time and resources. As you can see, the PCB manufacturing is to a high-quality standard, and the one I received worked straight away without any problems.
