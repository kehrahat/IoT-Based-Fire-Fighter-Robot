A water pump is a mechanical device that is designed to circulate coolant through water-cooled engines. Although not all water-cooled engines use water pumps, these components are at the heart of nearly all modern water-cooling systems. Water pumps are typically driven via the rotation of the crankshaft, although that can be accomplished in a variety of different ways. There are also a number of different styles of pumps that are commonly used.
